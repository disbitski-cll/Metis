# Decentralized Confidential Computing

On most blockchains, all data is public by default. While this works for most of the popular Web3 applications we see today, having the ability to keep some data confidential unlocks powerful new use-cases. Some examples of what this can enable are private voting for DAOs, secure random number generation for gaming, encrypted databases for various applications, using NFTs to control access to confidential data, sealed-bid auctions, and encrypted order books for DeFi applications. All of this can be achieved on Metis by utilizing [Secret Network](https://scrt.network)’s Confidential Computing Layer.

## How to integrate Secret's Confidential Computing Layer​

You can integrate Secret’s CCL into an existing Metis application, or design a new application from the ground up to take advantage of the unique use-cases it enables.

To start, check out Secret Network’s [Confidential Computing Layer](https://scrt.network/confidential-computing-layer/) page to get an overview of how it works, and example use-cases for inspiration. From there you’ll find multiple links to Secret's CCL documentation:

1. [Basics](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/basics) - explains the cross-chain communication technologies used, and how to connect a MetaMask wallet to Secret Network.
2. [Use-cases](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/usecases) - provides tutorials showing how to build various types of EVM applications using Secret’s CCL. All of these tutorials can be used to deploy a contract on Metis.
3. [Supported Networks](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/supported-networks) - provides a list of gateway contract addresses. This is how your Metis application will communicate with Secret.
